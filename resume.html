                <h4>Release Engineer</h4>
                <blockquote>Tech lead of the release engineering team at Yelp in San Francisco. We built and maintained most of the systems and tools that were used by the other developers to do their work. Including managing Git, Jenkins, and much of the sandboxing tools (increasingly based on Docker).</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Primary project was a large distributed test runner built on top of Mesos in Python and running on AWS. Relied heavily upon Elasticsearch, Spot Instances, pre-baked images in an auto scaling group that grew and shrank based on usage. In support of this we also built command line tools, dashboards, APIs and javascript single-page webapps. Team member spoke about it at AWS re:Invent 2015. Available on Youtube under the title "(ARC348) Yelp's Distributed System for Concurrent Task Execution."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Managed our large set of AWS and physical instances using Puppet and other tools such as Sensu.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Team was also responsible for defining release processes and requirements in addition to being on weekly rotating on-call to deal with outages and failures. We were at the intersection of the infrastructure and product teams and played a major role in driving consensus between teams.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Contributed to the improvement of our time-series monitoring tool. The open-source graphing portion of this is available on Github at Yelp/firefly.
