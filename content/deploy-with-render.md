Well now that we've managed to move this website one time, let's move it again! In the time since the last post I moved this to a Github Pages but I want to try something new.

I already did the hard part of modernizing the generator to something from this decade so the next step shouldn't be too hard.
Fortunately, Render tells me it is the fastest way to deploy this site, let's put that claim to the test!
